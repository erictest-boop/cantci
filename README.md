# Image ID and lookup

## Pairtree

Identifiers are assumed to be numeric OIDs.  Last 2 digits are placed first for randomness.  If the OID is made up of an odd number of digits, the final digit is ignored when constructing the pairtree path.  

For example, OID `12345` results in `/45/12/34/12345.tif`

## Image type

Assumes images are TIFF and end with the `.tif` extension.
